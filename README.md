# TvOSMoreButtonObjC
Objetive-C port of https://github.com/cgoldsby/TvOSMoreButton

Currently ellipses string being customized isn't currently supported, in the course of trying to add that functionality I broke something in the size detection code and rather than figuring that out I reverted to a state that worked, but was missing some functionality.

If this port becomes popular I will make it into a cocoapod and debug why some localizaton issues arent working, but at very least I will (eventually) take time to clean up the code and get custom ellipses working. For now this is the best I can offer.
